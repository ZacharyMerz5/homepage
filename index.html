  <p>I have been a NASCAR fan for a long time. My favorite driver is Kyle Larson and he has been my favorite since 2013. I started watching NASCAR in 2013 and I have stuck with it ever since. My dad used to like Jeff Gordon, but now he likes Bubba Wallace.</p>

  <p>My family and I go to races pretty often. We have gone to a race every year since 2015 except for 2020, 2021, and 2024. We have been to a lot of different tracks like Kentucky, Indianapolis, Talladega, Martinsville, Bristol, Daytona, Charlotte, and Michigan. Next year in 2026, we are planning to go to Rockingham and Darlington.</p>

  <p>I love going to races because being at the track is way better than watching on TV. TV does not show how intense it really is and some people think they just go in circles. When you are there in person the fan experience is insane. The atmosphere is crazy, the smell of race fuel and burning rubber is really cool, and once you stick with a driver you get hooked. They also race on many different track types, not just the simple circle people always talk about.</p>

<h2>These are the races I've been to so far in my lifetime:</h2>
<ol> <strong>
  <li> 2015: Kentucky
  <li> 2016: Indianapolis
  <li> 2017: Talladega
  <li> 2018: Martinsville
  <li> 2019: Kentucky
  <li> 2022: Charlotte
  <li> 2023: Bristol
  <li> 2025: Daytona, Michigan, and Indianapolis
</ol> </strong>

  <p>I also enjoy fishing. I fish a lot in the summer at my neighborhood pond in Mason, Ohio. Sharks are actually my favorite animal and my dream is to catch one someday. On every vacation near the ocean my goal for the whole week is to try and catch a shark, but I have not gotten one yet. Still, I keep trying because I know one day it will happen.🦈</p>
